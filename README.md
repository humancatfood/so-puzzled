# So Puzzled
A little puzzle game for practice, written in React and jQueryUI 

---

## How to run

 - clone the repo
 - cd into the **so puzzled** folder
 - run `npm install` (needs NodeJS and Bower installed)
 - run `npm start`
 - open a web-browser and navigate to ´localhost:3000´

OR ..

go to http://humancatfood.github.io/so-puzzled/


## TODOs:

- rewrite and apply scss as css-in-js (maybe styled components)
- use getBoundingBox functions to figure out empty stage spots and populate them by shuffling pieces there
  - account for piece sizes
  - use poisson disc sampling to find organic spots on stage
